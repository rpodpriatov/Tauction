The error you're encountering is related to an aborted transaction in the database. This is a common issue when an earlier database operation within a transaction fails, and any subsequent queries or commands are ignored until the transaction block is closed. Here’s a breakdown of the error and possible causes:

Error Breakdown:
Error Type: psycopg2.errors.InFailedSqlTransaction
The error message indicates that the transaction is in an aborted state, and further commands are being ignored until the transaction ends.
Cause: A previous operation in the current transaction failed, which automatically marks the transaction as aborted. Once a transaction is marked as aborted, no further SQL commands can be executed until the transaction is rolled back or closed. In this case, the error occurs during a SELECT query on the auctions table, specifically when trying to update the Dutch auctions (WHERE auctions.auction_type = 'DUTCH').
SQLAlchemy Query:
sql

SELECT auctions.id AS auctions_id, auctions.title AS auctions_title, auctions.description AS auctions_description, auctions.starting_price AS auctions_starting_price, auctions.current_price AS auctions_current_price, auctions.end_time AS auctions_end_time, auctions.is_active AS auctions_is_active, auctions.creator_id AS auctions_creator_id, auctions.auction_type AS auctions_auction_type, auctions.current_dutch_price AS auctions_current_dutch_price, auctions.dutch_price_decrement AS auctions_dutch_price_decrement, auctions.dutch_interval AS auctions_dutch_interval 
FROM auctions 
WHERE auctions.is_active = true AND auctions.auction_type = %(auction_type_1)s
Possible Causes:
Previous Transaction Failure:
A failure in a previous SQL operation could have caused the transaction to abort, but the session was not rolled back or committed properly. This leads to the "current transaction is aborted" error when trying to execute subsequent queries.
Uncaught Exception in Previous Query:
If there was an exception (e.g., constraint violation, syntax error) in a prior query, and the exception was not properly handled, it could leave the transaction in an aborted state.
Concurrent Transactions Issue:
If you are running multiple transactions concurrently, one transaction might have failed due to a lock or conflict, causing the current one to abort. This is more common in high-frequency queries or updates, such as in the update_dutch_auctions function that seems to run every 10 seconds.
Solution Approaches:
Ensure Transaction Handling:
Check the entire code block that interacts with the database to ensure that transactions are properly committed or rolled back when an error occurs. For instance, use session.rollback() in an except block to make sure that the session is reset after a failure.
Error Handling in update_dutch_auctions:
Surround the database interaction with proper exception handling:
python
Копировать код
try:
    dutch_auctions = db_session.query(Auction).filter(
        Auction.is_active == True,
        Auction.auction_type == 'DUTCH'
    ).all()
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error fetching Dutch auctions: {str(e)}")
    db_session.rollback()  # Rollback the transaction if an error occurs
Inspect Logs for Previous Failures:
Review the logs before the transaction failure to identify if there were any errors in previous database operations.
Commit or Rollback Transactions:
Ensure that transactions are properly committed or rolled back before starting new queries. You might want to ensure db_session.commit() or db_session.rollback() is called where appropriate.
Reduce Transaction Scope:
Limit the scope of transactions. If multiple operations are bundled into a single transaction, isolate them where possible to avoid cascading failures.
By ensuring that previous transaction errors are handled and rolling back the session when needed, you can resolve this issue.
